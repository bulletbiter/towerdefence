# Tower Defence - Phaser 3 Starter

Simple 2D Tower Defence starter built with Phaser 3.

How to run locally (no build tools required):

1. Start a local static file server from the project folder:

```bash
cd /home/mfohr/code/towerdefence
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open your browser at `http://localhost:8000` and the game will load.

Controls:
- Click a grid cell to place a tower (cost 50).
- Click "Start Wave" to spawn enemies.

Next steps you might want me to do:
- Add tower upgrades and sell option
- Add multiple enemy types and waves
- Add persistent assets (images/sprites) and sound effects
- Improve collision and performance for many bullets/enemies

If you want, I can implement any of the above next.
